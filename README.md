This function emulates the R version of [`dput()`](http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/base/html/dput.html), which writes ascii representations of variables that can be easily pasted back in and evaluated to recreate the objects. This is especially useful for quickly posting short reproducible examples on sites like [Stack Overflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com), without having to upload any separate data files.
