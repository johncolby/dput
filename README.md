This function emulates the R version of [`dput()`](http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/base/html/dput.html), which writes an ascii representation of an object that can be easily pasted back in and evaluated to recreate the object. This is especially useful for quickly posting short reproducible examples on sites like [Stack Overflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com), without having to upload any separate data files.
